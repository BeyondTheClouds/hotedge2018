% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\subsection*{Abstract}
Driven by several use-cases related to IoT and NFV, a cloud computing platform that leverages edge infrastructures has currently garnered a lot of attention. Despite this attention however, a management platform that is suitable for such an infrastructure is yet to be developed. In this paper, we introduce requirements that edge infrastructures and their users put on a cloud management system. We identify two approaches, top-down and bottom-up, for building a cloud management that fulfills the requirements. We discuss the pros and cons of each approach, and finally give our recommendation on which approach to follow.
