\subsection*{Abstract}
While it is clear that \edge infrastructures are required for emerging
use-cases related to IoT, VR or NFV, there is currently no resource management
system able to deliver all features for the \edge that made \cloudcomputing successful
%that make the success of
%\cloudcomputing for the \edge 
(\eg an OpenStack for the \edge).
%
Since building a system from scratch is seen by many as impractical,
this paper provides reflections regarding how existing solutions can be leveraged.
%how we can leverage existing
%resource management
%solutions. % to design it.
%
To that end, we provide a list of the features required to administer and use
\edgecomputing resources, and investigate how an existing IaaS manager (\ie
OpenStack) satisfies these requirements. Finally, we identify from this study two
approaches to design an \edge infrastructure manager that fulfils our
requirements, and discuss their \emph{pros} and \emph{cons}. This paper aims at
initiating the discussion in our community. 

%Driven by several use-cases related to IoT and NFV, a cloud computing platform
%that leverages edge infrastructures has currently garnered a lot of attention.
%Despite the attention however, a management platform that is suitable for such
%an infrastructure is yet to be developed. In this paper, we introduce
%requirements that edge infrastructures and their users put on a cloud
%management system. We identify two approaches, \emph{top-down} and
%\emph{bottom-up}, for building a cloud management that fulfills the
%requirements. We discuss \emph{pros} and \emph{cons} of each approach, and
%finally give our recommendation moving forward.
