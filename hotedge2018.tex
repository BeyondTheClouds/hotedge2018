% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of

% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,

% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file.

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\subsection*{Abstract}
While it is clear now that Edge infrastructures are required for emerging
use-cases related to IoT, VR or NFV, there is currently no resource management
platform that is able to deliver all the features that make the success of
Cloud Computing, for Edge infrastructures (\eg an OpenStack for the Edge).
%
Since building such a platform from scratch is impossible for our community,
this paper provides reflections regarding how we can leverage existing
resource management solutions to design it.
%
To that end, we provide a list of the features required to administrate and use
Edge Computing resources, and investigate how existing IaaS managers (\ie
OpenStack) satisfy these requirements. Finally, we identify from this study two
approaches to design an Edge infrastructure manager that fulfills our
requirements, and discuss their related pros and cons.

%Driven by several use-cases related to IoT and NFV, a cloud computing platform
%that leverages edge infrastructures has currently garnered a lot of attention.
%Despite the attention however, a management platform that is suitable for such
%an infrastructure is yet to be developed. In this paper, we introduce
%requirements that edge infrastructures and their users put on a cloud
%management system. We identify two approaches, \emph{top-down} and
%\emph{bottom-up}, for building a cloud management that fulfills the
%requirements. We discuss \emph{pros} and \emph{cons} of each approach, and
%finally give our recommendation moving forward.
