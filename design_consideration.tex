\section{Design Considerations}
\label{design_considerations}

The Edge Infrastructure we consider is an infrastructure that
is composed of up to hundreds of micro DCs, which are themselves
composed of up to one hundred servers (up to two racks). Figure 1
gives an overview of a Fog/Edge architecture with several micro/nano
DCs and the expected latency between each element. The network links
can be either wired or wireless (represented by plain and dashed lines
on the figure). Finally, it might be possible to consider additional
DCs deployed at the Extreme Edge, within a private institution.
