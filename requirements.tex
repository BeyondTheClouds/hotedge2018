\label{sec:requirements}

As mentionned, administrators and end-users of edge infrastructures expect to get a set of high
level mechanisms whose assembly results in a system capable of
operating a geo-distributed IaaS infrastructure.
Those mechanisms include primary services that are needed to operate and use
resources on demand~\cite{moreno2012csp} 
\begin{itemize}
\item The virtual machines manager is in charge of managing VMs’ cycle
  of life (configuration, scheduling, deployment, suspend/resume and
  shut down).
  \AL[DP]{Please emphasize that here we talk about VM but the manager can manager container or bare-metals}
\item The Image manager is in charge of VM’ template files (a.k.a. VM
  images).
\item The Network manager provides connectivity to the infrastructure:
  virtual networks for VMs and external access for users.
\item The Storage manager provides persistent storage facilities to
  VMs.
\item The Administrative tools provide user interfaces to operate and
  use the infrastructure.
\item Finally, the Information manager monitors data of the
  infrastructure for the auditing/accounting.
\end{itemize}

Those services enables administrators and developers/end-users to respectively operate and use the infrasrtucture on demand.
In the following, we propose a class
Thus the challenge is to investigate how each of the aforementioned services should be implemented


In this section, we identify
