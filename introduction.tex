TODO: talk about:
The NIST Cloud Computing Program (NCCP) recognized, in the USG Cloud Computing Standards and Technology Roadmap (NIST SP 500-293), the importance of advancement and development of frameworks to support seamless implementation of federated community cloud environments. In August 2017, the NCCP Public Working Group (PWG) on Federated Cloud (PWGFC) initiated a collaborative effort with the IEEE P2302 group, Standards for Intercloud Interoperability and Federation (SIIF), to advance Federated Cloud through the development of a conceptual architecture and a vocabulary. The IEEE P2302 will develop a standard based on the NIST model.
