The popularity of the Internet of Things, the current trend of virtualizing network functions as well as a new breed of applications such as AR/VR, heralds a new era of cloud computing where cloud platforms need to leverage edge infrastructures in order to be able to give an acceptable level of cost and performance to users and operators.  Despite this growing need however, there does not seem to be any cloud management platform that is designed having such an infrastructure in mind. In this paper, we outlined a systematic grouping of the features that end-users expect and the requirements an edge infrastructure puts on a cloud management system. We also identified existing efforts in this area and which may be used as a starting point to a full-blown solution. We then proceed to describe two possible strategies to follow when designing a solution: (1) a \emph{top-down} approach that keeps existing software untouched and attempts to implement features by software that run on the top and (2) a \emph{bottom-up} approach that extensively improves existing software in order to fulfill the requirements. We discuss the pros and cons of each strategy and  give our recommendation on how we believe we should move forward in a design for a cloud platform for an edge infrastructure.
