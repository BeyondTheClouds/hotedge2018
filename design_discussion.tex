\section{Design Discussion}
\label{sec:design_discussion}
On the one hand, \emph{top-down} design have been the most explored, but can these alone fulfil all expected requirements? On the other hand, \emph{bottom-up} design seem to disruptive the design principles of most existing VIMs, but should it be discarded?

\paragraph{Top-Down Design}
In a top-down design, the system relies on existing VIM APIs and
overlay components, with no modifications to the codebase of the VIM.
This absence of modifications is of particular importance in
OpenStack, since it provides a new release every six months with a lot
of changes in the codebase, whereas changes rarely impact the APIs.
Therefore, a top-down design gives independence to both VIM
development and overlay system components. If designed to do so, the
system can easily allow L4 requirements, \ie the support of different
VIMs and different versions of a VIM - \eg
FogBow~\cite{brasileiro2016fogbow}.

However certain requirements cannot be fulfilled without changing the
core of a VIM (\eg L2 type of requirements like live migration and
virtual networking across sites). For example, OpenStack
Tricircle~\cite{tricircle}, a project that aims to allow virtual
networking across different sites by introducing an overlay component,
ended up "breaking" the core of OpenStack by introducing non-standard
mechanisms in order to fulfill the requirements. Missing Edge relative
VIM features such as a fined authorization management with different
rights in different Edge sites means that many low-level VIM services
need to be reimplemented at the overlay level (\eg authentication,
resource scheduling, resource monitoring, etc). Ultimately, one might
end reimplementing repeatedly the entire low level system at higher
levels.

%% Moreover, in order to operate a distributed Edge infrastructure through a single logical entry point, it means that many low-level VIM services need to be reimplemented at the overlay level (\eg authentication, resource scheduling, resource monitoring, etc). Ultimately, one might end reimplementing repeatedly the entire low level system at higher levels.



%An interesting fact about existing \emph{top-down} is that nearly all ...

%------Moreover, if different VIM flavors are deployed, it might become impractical to provide a single VIM management-view to users as different VIMs might have specific features that need to be managed.


\paragraph{Bottom-Up Design}
In a \emph{bottom-up} design, the system is not limited by what is
made available through VIM APIs. If one can make OpenStack natively
collaborative, this can allow to support features across the entire
Edge infrastructure for free. For instance, the OpenStack ``boot a
VM'' process looks as follow from a bird's-eye view: (1) Get the URL
of the image by looking up into the database, (2) Schedule and boot
the VM. Thus, booting a VM on \emph{Site 1} using an image defined in
\emph{Site 2} is the same workflow as booting a VM on \emph{Site 1}
using an image defined in \emph{Site 1} if both sites shared the same
data (\ie database backend).

However, the efficiency and ease to support collaboration comes at a
cost. OpenStack has not been designed with distribution, like the one
of edge scenarios, in mind. This kind of collaboration may be achieved
with a collaborative backend that relies on a notion of \emph{space}.
A \emph{space} says in which space the OpenStack lookup and write
data. It could be an Edge site or a combination of Edge sites if the
collaboration is needed. It leads to a more efficient system, one
without the need to repeatedly implement features at different levels.
But, implementing a backend based on a notion of space represents a
scientific challenge. With the high industry demand for a working Edge
system, this means that modifying or extending OpenStack is in most
cases too expensive (time and resource wise). Note also that such
backend will not free the developer to implement specific workflows
for intra-services scenarios\RACm{For instance the ``list of actually
scheduling VM'' could not be reused from vanilla code}.

%Moreover, it can potentially fullfil any and all (reasonable) requirements since any feature missing can be implemented.

%% However, the efficiency and ease to support new features comes at a cost. Most existing systems, \eg OpenStack, were not designed with distribution, like the one of edge scenarios, in mind. With the high industry demand for a working Edge system, this means that modifying or extending existing systems (or even creating a new system) is in most cases too expensive (time and resource wise).
%% Moreover, a \emph{bottom-up} approach would certainly mean the entire Edge infrastructure would rely on a specific platform/VIM, which seems to be a unrealistic scenario today due to the still fragmented VIM landscape. On a short-term, a way to overcome this would be to have a complementary \emph{top-down} system. On a longer perspective, the ideal scenario would be for the industry to agree on a standardized system in a similar way as it has done for mobile communications with 3GPP~\cite{3gpp}.

\paragraph{Summary}
In the end, there are \emph{pros} and \emph{cons} in both approaches, and none individually seems to fulfil all technical and business requirements of edge scenarios.
On a technical perspective, a \emph{top-down} approach brings modularity and independence between system components, however it is limited by that same independence as it requires low-level features to be enabled to fulfil all requirements. Moreover, a full working system would be far from effient as several features need to be implemented at different levels.
A \emph{bottom-up} approach can produce a more efficient system that can easily support additional requirements.
On a business perspective, a \emph{top-down} approach can easily fulfil the short and medium-term Time-To-Market (TTM) requirements. In that sense, \emph{top-down} is the working solution the community needs to aim for first, and is in fact the one it has been working towards so far. However, serious effort needs to be put on a long-term solution that lays on a \emph{bottom-up} approach.

%% As a starting point, early \emph{bottom-up} efforts

%%  can be taken into account along with mechanisms that have been implemented in \emph{top-down} solutions but can be applied in a \emph{bottom-up} way~\cite{ericsson-p2p}.


%% \JM{Would a picture somewhere in the paper with a simplified view of a top-down system vs a bottom-up one help the reader? Maybe in section 3.3? I think it would be useful, but we would need to cut somewhere to make it fit in the 5 pages}

%NOTES:
%The way to go is bottom up. Top-down, fastest TTM, a quick fix. That is how everyone is doing it, and thatis the way. BUt that is no the way it should be designed. Short-medium term, top-down...long-run, bottom-up.

%Top-down: requirements, then implement it
%Bottom-up: not all requirments, but implement something. Can top-down approaches be partially used and implemented in a bottom-up.
